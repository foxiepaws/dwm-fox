* dwm-fox

dwm-fox is my own little fork/configuration of dwm. It is similar to
the idea of dwm-sprinkles, only is customised for me. It brings in
several changes like XFT, nmaster, a systray, different layouts,
compositing/opacity, and a colour scheme I actually like. Whilst it
never actually reached the level I wanted it to, I do still use this
every single day as my default window manager.

** Configuration
Configuring dwm (and by extension, dwm-fox) is easy. Just open up your
favourite text editor and modify config.h. You'll need to understand C
a little to customise dwm properly. This is by design, but for the
sake of practicing documentation, I'll write a few examples of how you
can change it.

*** Changing the colours
#+BEGIN_SRC C
static const char normbordercolor[] = "#";
static const char normbgcolor[]     = "#";
static const char normfgcolor[]     = "#";
static const char selbordercolor[]  = "#";
static const char selbgcolor[]      = "#";
static const char selfgcolor[]      = "#";
#+END_SRC

*** Turning off the systray
#+BEGIN_SRC C
static const Bool showsystray       = False;     /* False means no systray */
#+END_SRC

*** Changing the name of the tags
edit tags[] with the name you want, really easy. 
#+BEGIN_SRC C
/* very bad example */
static const char *tags[] = { "IRC", "CODE", "MUSIC", "...", "...", "...", "...", "...", "WWW" };
#+END_SRC 

*** Applying changes
To apply the changes, you need to recompile dwm.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$EDITOR config.mk # modify this so your prefix and option choices are correct.
make
make install # run this AFTER quitting dwm.
#+END_SRC
