fox's dwm config
----------------

This is my new dwm config, it has a few cool features.

  * Colour scheme based off of Zenburn (using Awesome's theme file)
  * Notification Area! you no longer need a trayer.
  * horizontal layouts + columns
  * a configurable useless gap
  * statusbar on bottom
  * Xft Support! 

Here is what needs to happen before it is totally finished

  * Dvorak layout patch
  * combo key bindings
  * better key bindings for layouts
  * ~/.dwmrc file patch (allowing for system wide xinitrc's to not have to be modified for wallpapers and programs we use, e.g. ubuntu and debian.)
