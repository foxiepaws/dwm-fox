fox's dwm config
----------------

This is my new dwm config, it has a few cool features.

    * Colour scheme based off of Zenburn (using Awesome's theme file)
    * Notification Area! you no longer need a trayer.
    * horizontal layouts + columns
    * a configurable useless gap


Here is what needs to happen before it is totally finished

    * Dvorak layout patch
    * combo key bindings
    * better key bindings for layouts
    * XFT (for UTF-8 title support) 
        * The patch for this does not work with other patches so its going to be a manual merge :/
    * ~/.dwmrc file patch (allowing for system wide xinitrc's to not have to be modified for wallpapers and programs we use, e.g. ubuntu and debian.)
