fox's dwm config
----------------

This is my new dwm config, it has a few cool features.

  * Colour scheme based off of Solarized
  * Notification Area! you no longer need a trayer.
  * Horizontal layouts + columns
  * Statusbar on bottom
  * Xft Support without losing xlfr.
  * Transparency with xcompmgr
  * ~/.dwmrc feature
    * spawned session for programs like feh to set wallpapers.
